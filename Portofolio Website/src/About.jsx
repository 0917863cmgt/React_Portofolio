            <p>
                Hello there! 
                My name is Carlo Tijmons and during my bachelors degree I have been diversely learning about different fields within the realm of computer science.
                During my studies I've had my fare share of learning about different programming languages like JavaScript, Python, PHP C++ etc.
                From building websites for costumers without frameworks with CRUD functionality.
                To building websites with the help of frameworks like React and Node for fullstack solutions.
                I've also delved into MVC frameworks like Laravel, ASP.NET Core for other projects.
                In my studies I've also had the upportunity to do projects where the use of hardware was required for getting involved in the IOT world by using sensors and actuators.
                Games were also a theme in my studies I've had the chance to try out Typescript for making website supported games.
                In these projects I've had the chance to understand OOP and began to understand the importance and usecases of certain code design parterns.
                At the end of my studies I've been interested in trying to develop my designing skills a bit more.
                This helped me to build an acceptable quality mock-up of my own app concept.
                And lastly I've tried to deepen my knowledge about AI since the it's become a mainstream since 2022 and I've tried to develop a Convolutional Neural Network for recognising animal sound patterns.

                My study has also trained to be well known with the Agile work methodology.
                Entrepeneurship was also a skills that was tested during my bachelors since most team based projects were required to ideate, test and develop concepts in iterations.
                This also required me to do a lot of research on different topics or social dilemmas.

                Now that it's time for me to find a suitable job for my skills. 
                I'm also further honing my skills for webdevelopment, by trying out the frameworks I've not yet tried.
                Also Leetcode is currently my new hobby to try and master other languages like C++ on a higher level than I've had the chance to develop in.
